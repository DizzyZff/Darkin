# Project Darkin

Project Darkin is aimed to train a neural network to play the MOBA game League of Legends. The project is currently in development and is not yet ready for use.

## Introduction

The project is based on the [League of Legends API](https://developer.riotgames.com/). The API is used to get the current state of the game and to send commands to the game. The game is played in the [client](https://signup.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/redownload) and is not played in the browser.

In order to train an AI agent to play the game, following TODOs should be performed.

    Define the problem and decide on the approach: Decide what kind of AI you want to build (e.g. reinforcement learning, supervised learning, etc.).

    Acquire data: Gather data on League of Legends gameplay, such as game replays and champion statistics.

    Pre-process data: Clean and prepare the data so that it can be used to train the AI model.

    Develop the AI model: Train the AI model using the pre-processed data. This step will likely require writing code to implement the AI algorithm and using a machine learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

    Evaluate the AI model: Test the AI model and evaluate its performance. You may need to make adjustments to the AI model and repeat steps 4 and 5 until you are satisfied with its performance.

    Integrate the AI model into the League of Legends game environment: Once the AI model has been trained and evaluated, integrate it into the game environment so that it can play League of Legends.

The project is currently in phase one. The problem is defined and the approach is decided. The next step is to acquire data. The data will be gathered by playing the game and recording the game state. The data will be pre-processed and the AI model will be developed. The AI model will be evaluated and integrated into the game environment.
